## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd podcast_txt
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up OpenAI API key**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

## Usage

### Start the Web App

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the Flask app
python3 app.py
```

The app will be available at: **http://127.0.0.1:5002**

### Using the Web Interface

1. **Enter RSS Feed URL**: Paste your podcast's RSS feed URL
2. **Convert Apple Podcasts URLs**: Use the built-in converter for Apple Podcasts links
3. **Select Episode**: Choose from the list of available episodes
4. **Start Transcription**: Click "Start Transcription" and watch real-time progress
5. **Download Results**: Get both transcript (.txt) and subtitle (.srt) files

### Finding RSS Feeds

The app includes a comprehensive help guide for finding RSS feeds from:
- **Apple Podcasts**: Automatic URL conversion to RSS
- **Spotify**: Instructions to find original RSS feeds
- **Google Podcasts**: Guidance for locating RSS feeds
- **Direct RSS**: How to find RSS feeds from podcast websites

## How It Works

### Audio Processing
- **Smart Splitting**: Large files (>25MB) are automatically split into chunks
- **Sequential Processing**: Each chunk is transcribed separately
- **Seamless Assembly**: Results are combined with proper timestamps

### Error Handling
- **Download Protection**: Handles 403 errors from hosting services like Buzzsprout
- **Retry Logic**: Multiple header strategies for different podcast hosts
- **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful feedback when downloads fail

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application interface
- `POST /parse_rss` - Parse RSS feed and list episodes
- `POST /start_transcription` - Start transcription process
- `GET /transcription/<task_id>` - View transcription results
- `GET /status/<task_id>` - Get real-time transcription status
- `GET /download/<task_id>/<format>` - Download transcript files
- `GET /rss-help` - RSS feed help guide
- `POST /convert-apple-url` - Convert Apple Podcasts URL to RSS

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (required)

### File Size Limits
- **OpenAI Limit**: 25MB per audio file
- **Auto-Splitting**: Files larger than 24MB are split automatically
- **Chunk Size**: Optimal chunk duration for best transcription quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **403 Forbidden Error**
   - Some podcast hosts (like Buzzsprout) restrict direct downloads
   - Try a different episode or contact the podcast creator

2. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check the `.env` file contains your API key

3. **Large File Processing**
   - Files are automatically split for OpenAI's 25MB limit
   - Processing time scales with audio length

### Performance Tips

- **First Run**: May take longer as dependencies are downloaded
- **Long Episodes**: Transcription time is typically 1/10th of audio duration
- **Memory Usage**: Flask app is lightweight, most processing is done by OpenAI

## Dependencies

- `flask` - Web framework
- `requests` - HTTP requests
- `feedparser` - RSS feed parsing
